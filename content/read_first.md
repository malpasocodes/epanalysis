# Read First: Understanding Our Metrics

## 1. Why This Matters

The Higher Ed ROI Research Lab uses two core measures — **Earnings Premium** and **Return on Investment (ROI)** — to evaluate the economic value of postsecondary education programs.

These measures are central to recent and upcoming policy debates, including federal legislation under Title VIII, Subtitle E, which ties program eligibility for federal funds to graduate earnings outcomes.

We present each metric under two different calculation methods:
- **C-Metric** – aligns with the Current methodology embedded in the new legislation.
- **H-Metric** – an alternative formulation proposed by Phil Hill, designed to reflect local economic conditions more directly.

## 2. Key Concepts

**Earnings Premium**
- **Definition:** The difference between the median earnings of program graduates and the median earnings of a baseline comparison group (usually working adults without the degree in question).
- **Interpretation:** A higher premium means graduates earn more than the baseline group; a negative premium means they earn less.

**Return on Investment (ROI)**
- **Definition:** The number of years it takes for the earnings premium to "repay" the program's total net cost to the student.
- **Interpretation:** Lower ROI values indicate faster cost recovery; higher values mean longer repayment times.

## 3. The C-Metric (Current Law Approach)

**Baseline for Earnings Premium:**
- **Associate's degree or lower:**  
  Median earnings of a working adult (25–34 years old) without a bachelor's degree, calculated statewide.
- **Data source:** U.S. Census Bureau (American Community Survey), state-level.
- **Graduate/Professional degree:**  
  Median earnings of a working adult with only a bachelor's degree (lowest of State / State-by-field / National-by-field).

**Calculation Steps:**
1. **Earnings Premium (C-Metric)**  
   Graduate Median Earnings - Statewide Baseline
   
2. **ROI (C-Metric)**  
   Total Net Price ÷ Earnings Premium → expressed in years.

## 4. The H-Metric (Phil Hill Approach)

**Baseline for Earnings Premium:**
- Uses local (county-level) median earnings for working adults without the degree.
- Same ACS source, but computed using county weights rather than statewide averages.

**Calculation Steps:**
1. **Earnings Premium (H-Metric)**  
   Graduate Median Earnings - Local (County) Baseline
   
2. **ROI (H-Metric)**  
   Total Net Price ÷ Earnings Premium (H) → expressed in years.

## 5. Why We Show Both

- **C-Metric** reflects the standard policymakers will use to enforce program eligibility under the new law.
- **H-Metric** reflects a locally adjusted perspective that may better capture regional cost-of-living and wage variations.
- Comparing both provides context and helps avoid overgeneralizing from a single baseline.

## 6. Important Note

These metrics are not designed for individual decision-making about colleges. They are analytical tools for researchers, policymakers, and analysts to evaluate policy implications, compare institutions, and identify systemic patterns.
